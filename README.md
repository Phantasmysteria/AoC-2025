# AoC-2025

Another year, another Advent of Code coinciding with finals month. 

Except this year I have no final exams, because I have already graduated.

Since it is finals month, I would recommend students to use AoC as practice for coding and/or algorithms courses. (But please don't spend too much time on it, better study the actual syllabus!)
